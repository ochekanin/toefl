**Reducing global environmental damage should be handled by governments rather
than individuals. Do you agree or disagree? Give reasons for your answer and
provide relevant examples from your own experience. (35 words)**

Environmental dangers induced by humanity activity is a common problem for all
governments and humans without regard to residence. Everyone suffers from global
warming, massive air pollution and lots of garbage produced by humans. One can
change living habits, become more eco-friendly and take care about nature, but
it makes no sense if government doesn't pursue policy for protecting
environment. Therefore I believe that official position of governs is much more
important than individuals' actions.

One of tremendous threat is accumulating amount of garbage all around the globe.
There are a lot of plastic and other harmful materials that are not compostable
mankind has no ideas how to deal with. Rich countries send junk to poor
ones, mainly located in Asia, for recycling or utilization but, actually
it just thrown away in those countries. This year I have started sorting waste
for further recycling or environmently safe disposal. Such activity is quite
hard in Ukraine since government doesn't actually care about recycling and
existing laws have no power in reality. All is done by eco activists for
donations from concerned citizens. Their efforts will be much fruitful if
government supports them by providing efficient laws that meet challenges of our
time.
