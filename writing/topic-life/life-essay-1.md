*Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?
Our current way of life will have a negative impact on future generations
(29 words)*

For the last 50 years, mankind made bigger technological progress than ever in
the history. Technologies we have nowadays were considered as fantastic several
decades ago. There is a huge gap even between modern life and 1990s. But
everything has a price. Current and new generations will face with new issues:
changed environmental conditions, increasing humans population, robotization
and higher competitions for a job among humans.

Humanity was careless with nature for the last decades as regards garbage,
CO2 level, air and water pollution. Global warming already has come and we see
it as a higher monthly average temperature, melting glaceries, and spread of
diseases typical for tropics in other areas. Fresh water is already in demand
and there are regions where people suffer due to low quality of the water. In
the city I live temperature records are broken every year for several times.
It's accompanied by air pollution caused by dense car traffic and leads to the
health issues. Babies of the current generation will be affected not only by
worsened environment, but also weakened immunity of their parents.

Modern technological challenges humans set include exploration of other planets,
general artificial intelligence able to think as a human, delegating routines
to robots, and other fascinating goals. But what about people fired due to
downsizing or automatization of tasks usually done by humans? Studying new
profession is hard, especially for elder people who cannot compete with youngs.
Another implicit consequence will be increasing competetion for high-skill jobs
like engineers, artists, analytics. In the worst case it will lead to mass
protests, neo-luddism (internation movement claiming refuse of robotization and
automation), and social tension.

In sum, the next generations will live in completely another world and modern
people already prepared challenges for them. Environmental issues, demographic
and social crisis, widespreading automatization will be challenges humanity
have not ever faced and future prospects are tremendous.
